# Presentation

## Why?

Redmine is really powerful. Really. Many features and really customizables.
But I have to say that after 10 years of using it, the UX and the UI are now quite old and not as attractive as it used to be, well at least in my point of view.

So let's try to do something different! First version just a new version not a revolution, we'll see later how this could better.

## What?

A brand new theme whith a new layout and some principles
* should be clean and simple (only show main features first and then show other features on demand)
* should help to navigate really quickly
* should implement new features or integrate small ones from open-source plugins
* main features are : issue and projet
  * as a user I want to create a new project easily
  * as a user I want to create a new issus easily and update/delete it really quickly

## How?

* Plugin instead of a theme so that we can reorder items and add stimulus
* Tailwind css
* Stimulus for interactivity
* integration of small improvments seen in open sources plugins
* try to keep the compatibility with plugins when possible
