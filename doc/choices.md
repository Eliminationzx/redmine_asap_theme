# Choices

Sometimes it's impossible to keep the actual behaviour so choices are made. They are listed below.

## Font and colors

Font : Inter for his readibility
Light theme :
* Main : bg-blue-700

Dark theme :
* Main : bg-blue-900
* navigation : bg-slate-700
* background : bg-slate-800

## Navbar

App title
=> replace with a logo. The app title is still visible on hover

Footer
the mention : "Powered by Redmine Â© 2006-2023 Jean-Philippe Lang"
=> move to a dedicated popup avaiblable from menu "About" in the user menu

Administration
The first page is not so useful so the proposal is to access administration zone through a dropdown menu directly from the navbar.

## My account

Users are often confused about my account and my profile. The proposition is to rename My account to settings and to display it in a modal dialog box so that users don't need to change page.
