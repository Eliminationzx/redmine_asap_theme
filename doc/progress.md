# Progress & demos

## First step : layout & navbar

![First](img/first.gif)

The work start with the global layout (file `base.html.erb`) and the navbar.
On the left side, the projects navigation part with a breadcrumb to quickly go to the parent's projects of the current one.

On the right, the search field and a dropdown menu for the user menu.

Add project menu in the navbar

Finally add issue menu

![Three](img/three.png)

And start issues list

![first-issues](img/first-issues.png)

Tried something with issue (3 columns but only the one in the middle for now)

![first-issue](img/first-issue.png)

The idea : add a navigation on the left to go from one issue to another one.
In the middle, focus on the issue, all attributes are moved to the right panel.

Need to be improved and test
